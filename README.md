<h2> Introduction</h2>
This script allows you to perform a mass search for a specific name or search term within a directory of PDF files.
It creates a new text document that captures the surrounding body of text each time the search term is found.
<h2> Purpose and Background</h2>
Recently, our staff encountered a challenge where they needed to search through old newspapers, forms, journals, and
other documents that had been digitized into PDF files. Their task was to verify whether certain names appeared in
these documents. However, this process became incredibly tedious and time-consuming, given the large number of PDFs
that needed to be searched. To address this issue, I was assigned the task of developing a solution to facilitate
mass searching for names.
<h2> How it works</h2>
<ul>
<li> The script takes a directory of PDF files as input.
It searches through each PDF file to find instances of the specified name or search term.</li>
<li> For each occurrence of the search term, the script captures the surrounding body of text.</li>
<li>It creates a new text document that compiles all the captured text snippets, making it easier for users to
review
and verify the presence of the names they are searching for.</li>
</ul>
